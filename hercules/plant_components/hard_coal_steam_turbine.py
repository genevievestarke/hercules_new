Hard Coal Steam Turbine Class.

Hard coal steam turbine model is a subclass of the ThermalComponentBase class.
It implements the model as presented in [1], [2], [3], and [4].

Like other subclasses of ThermalComponentBase, it inherits the main control functions,
and adds defaults for many variables based on [1], [2], [3], and [4].
