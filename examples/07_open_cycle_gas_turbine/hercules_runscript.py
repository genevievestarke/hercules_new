"""Example 07: Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) simulation.

This example demonstrates a simple open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) that:
- Starts on at rated capacity (100 MW)
- At 10 minutes, receives a shutdown command and begins ramping down
- At ~20 minutes, reaches 0 MW and transitions to off
- At 40 minutes, receives a turn-on command with a setpoint of 100% of rated capacity
- At ~80 minutes, 1 hour down-time minimum is reached and the turbine begins hot starting
- At ~87 minutes, hot start completes, continues ramping up to 100% of rated capacity
- At 120 minutes, receives a command to reduce power to 50% of rated capacity
- At 180 minutes, receives a command to reduce power to 10% of rated capacity
        (note this is below the minimum stable load)
- At 210 minutes, receives a command to increase power to 100% of rated capacity
- At 240 minutes (4 hours), receives a shutdown command
- Simulation runs for 6 hours total with 1 minute time steps
